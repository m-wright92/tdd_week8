# Ruby Anagram Checker

#### Check if two words or sentances are anagrams

#### Mike Wright

## Technologies Used

* Ruby
* regex
* rspec
* pry
* colorize

## When you run the script file in this repo in your terminal it will prompt you to enter either two words or sentances or a mix. It will then compare the two and first verify if there are any vowels(basic test to see if it's an english word) and then compare all characters in the words/sentances while ignoring spaces and non-alphabetic characters to tell the user if they have found an anagram, antigram, or neither.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Run `bundle` in your terminal from within the root directory of this project
* To check all passing test specs, run `rspec` in the terminal, this will test all files in the 'spec' directory.
* Run `ruby script.rb` in the terminal from the root directory to interact with the function and see it in action.
* Answer prompts given
* This has only been tested in ruby 2.6.10, so it may not be compatible with older versions of ruby

## Known Bugs

* No known bugs at this time.
